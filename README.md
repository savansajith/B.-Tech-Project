# Solar-Terrestrial Relations: Statistical and Predictive Analysis of Solar Activity
## Abstract
We conduct a statistical analysis of the sunspot number (SSN) for solar cycle 25, which will be generated using an algorithm based on machine learning. For the purpose we utilized data from the Solar Influences Data Center (SILSO) Observatory located in Belgium. Our research began with a detailed pattern analysis of solar cycles and their characteristics, followed by a statistical analysis of SSN series data for solar cycles 1 to 24. This involved determining key parameters, which comprises 1 σ and 2 σ widths, mean SSN, skewness, kurtosis (excess kurtosis), and the definition of a "strength" parameter through two distinct approaches. This was achieved by skew-gaussian fitting of SSN data corresponding to each solar cycle. The strength parameter helped in identifying significant changes in SSN data; for example, a significant fall in the strength parameter was noticed during the transition from solar cycle 23 to 24 alongside generating a trend between the solar cycles, skewness and kurtosis. The prediction part used to forecast future SSN for the solar cycle 25 was done through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model which is trained on the monthly data from solar cycles 1 – 24. The model predicts monthly mean SSN for the next 150 months (2020–2032), allowing us to predict the entire graphical trend of solar cycle 25. Through our model we were able to forecast the future SSN data and predict the trend of solar cycle 25 through the LSTM model achieving ideal values of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination ($R^2$) indicating strong predictive accuracy. This technique was utilized in determining the statistical parameters of the predicted SSN trend for the solar cycle 25. Additionally classification of each solar cycle based on the skewness ie; left skewed or right skewed was also performed to verify the fact that even-numbered solar cycles tend to exhibit lower skewness and kurtosis compared to odd-numbered cycles. Finally, we verified a relationship between skewness and kurtosis across odd and even cycles: Odd-numbered cycles show a stronger correlation compared with even-numbered cycles. Our findings enhance the understanding of solar variability and provide a valuable foundation for improving future space weather forecasting models.
